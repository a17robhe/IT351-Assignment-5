    <string name="about_message">This app is intended to be used by comapnies that need to keep track of common buisness partners contact infromation. The info displayed in the list is fetched from a central server so each individual employee won\'t have to add them to their personal contact list themselves. Authentication and authorization would have to be implemented to make this a viable app though, sinc currently anyone can access the contact information in the JSON service.</string>
